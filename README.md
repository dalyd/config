# config
My config files

Configuration files should be versioned here, and then symbolically linked from home directory or wherever appropriate. 
The install_config.sh file can be used to setup the symbolic links. It
should be run from the config directory. 

Special case for .bash_local. .bash_local_osx should be linked to ~/.bash_local on OS X machines.
